    /*
     * This is the calculateLegalMoves method. As the name suggests, the purpose
     * of this method is to make a legal move for the bishop piece. Explanation of the exclusions are below, but 
     * it basically checks that for every tile that it can move based on CANDIDATE_MOVE_COORDINATE (Info
     * about CANDIDATE_MOVE_COORDINATE is above), we check if there's a tile that the piece can move to by using
     * a while loop for every tile that the piece can move being valid. Within the first while loop, we basically
     * check for the columns so the algorithm for the move coordinates won't fall. If there's no tile occupied on the tile
     * that the chess will go to, then a new MajorMove is created, mainly for non-attacking movement (View MajorMove
     * in Move class), and goes to a legalMove. Else, it initializes two variables: pieceAtDestionation, and pieceAlliance, which 
     * pieceDestination is a Piece variable, and pieceAlliance is an Alliance variable. It then checks
     * if the alliance of the current piece is the opposite, we do an attack move with MajorAttackMove
     * object being created and being added to the list of legal moves that are immutable.*/
